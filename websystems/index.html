          <h2>Canine Poet</h2>
            <p>
              Madame Tao is an admired canine poet, writing in the style of William
              Blake. Tao's poetry is featured in the esteemed collection
              <span class="code-highlight">Canine Poetry</span>, published by
              Platypus House in 2022. Tao was recently appointed Australia's

            </p>
            <p>Here is a quote from Madame Tao upon her appointment:</p>

            <blockquote cite="https://newtownreviewofbooks.com.au/">
            "I am delighted to be appointed Poet Laureate of Australia, and to describe my experiences of canine-hooman interactions with playfullness. More recently, my writing style is outward looking, and reflects my thoughts about the universe."
            </blockquote>

  <b>The Puppy</b>

  Puppy, puppy burning bright,

  In the parks and out of sight,

  What hooman hand or eye,

  Could curb thy bountiful energy? 
        </pre>

        <pre>
  <b>The Kindred</b>

  Oh puppy thou art free,

  The flying green tennis ball,

  That approaches from afar,

  How can it appear so small?


  You are looming large and within reach,

  Oh round and verdant sphere uncouthe,

  The joy you give is unbound,

  To wagging tail and slobbery mouth.
