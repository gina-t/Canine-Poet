            Born and bred in Sydney, Tao was educated at the elite <span class="code-highlight">School for Puppies</span>, and graduated with <em>honours</em>. She is an adventurer, long distance runner, champion swimmer and expert frisbee catcher. <em>Her interest in poetry</em> arose from the multitude of poetry books that surrounded her as a puppy. Tao started reading at the precocious age of three, and wrote her first poem at the age of five, in the style of Ogden Nash.

      <b>Worker Ants</b>

      Is it not funny 

      How little ants hurry

      To do their chores
      
      Without a pause.
