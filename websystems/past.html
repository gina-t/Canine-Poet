        <h1>Early Years</h1>
        <p>Born and bred in Sydney, Tao was educated at the elite School for Puppies, and graduated with honours. She is an adventurer, long distance runner, champion swimmer and expert frisbee catcher. Her interest in poetry arose from the multitude of poetry books that surrounded her as a puppy. Tao started reading at the precocious age of 3, and wrote her first poem at the age of 5.
